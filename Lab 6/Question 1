You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and values to be inserted into the tree. Insert the values into their appropriate position in the binary search tree and return the root of the updated binary tree. You just have to complete the function.

You are given a function,

Node * insert (Node * root ,int data) {

}
Input Format

First line of the input contains t, the number of nodes in the tree.
Second line of the input contains the list of t elements to be inserted to the tree.
Constraints

No. of nodes in the tree, 1  t  5000
Value of each node in the tree,  1  t[i]  10000
Output Format

Return the items in the binary search tree after inserting the values into the tree. Start with the root and follow each element by its left subtree, and then its right subtree.

Sample Input

6
4 2 3 1 7 6
Sample Output

4 2 1 3 7 6
Sample Explanation

The binary tree after inserting the 6 elements in the given order will look like this.
         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   /
    1   3 6
