You are given pointer to the root of the binary search tree and two values  and . You need to return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of  and  in the binary search tree.

Function Description
Complete the function lca in the editor below. It should return a pointer to the lowest common ancestor node of the two values given.

lca has the following parameters:
- root: a pointer to the root node of a binary search tree
- v1: a node.data value
- v2: a node.data value

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,n , the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing node.data values.
The third line contains two space-separated integers, v1 and v2.

The tree will contain nodes with data equal to v1 and v2.

Output Format

Return the a pointer to the node that is the lowest common ancestor of  and .

Sample Input
